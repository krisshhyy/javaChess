# javaChess
This is an online 1v1 Chess game developed using only JAVA language by me (Krishnendu Nandi - B.P. Poddar Institute of Management and Technolgy) and my friend (Arijit Banerjee - B.P. Poddar Institute of Management and Technolgy) as our 3rd year JAVA project on 2020.
In this project, Swing has been used for the GUI part and for the networking portion, Socket and Port have been used.
As of now, this game can be played using a localhost server (the local machine will act like a server), creating two client instances.
But we have plans to host it globally so that it can be played using a remote, 24x7 online server.

The other changes we have in mind are -
1) Improving the game UI
