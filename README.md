# javaChess
This is an online 1v1 Chess game developed using only JAVA language by me (Krishnendu Nandi - B.P. Poddar Institute of Management and Technolgy) and my friend (Arijit Banerjee - B.P. Poddar Institute of Management and Technolgy) as our 3rd year JAVA project on 2020.
In this project, Swing has been used for the GUI part and for the networking portion, Socket and Port have been used.
As of now, this game can be played using a localhost server (the local machine will act like a server), creating two client instances.
But we have plans to host it globally so that it can be played using a remote, 24x7 online server.

To play the game, one has to follow the mentioned steps -
1) Download the entire project.
2) Open the project in an IDE (preferably ECLIPSE).
3) Run the "Server.java". It will create an server on the local machine itself.
4) Run the "Client.java" two times (each one creates a unique client instance).
5) Play the game.

Our project may not be visually appealing to some, but in terms of implementing the basic Chess game functionality, we tried our level best.

The future changes we have in mind are -
1) Improving the game UI.
2) Making it a windows application.
3) Storing the end results in a hosted database to introduce ranking system.
4) Implementing the logics for Human vs Computer (for Offline mode).

THANK YOU !!!!
