# javaChess
This is an online 1v1 Chess game developed using only JAVA language by me (Krishnendu Nandi - B.P. Poddar Institute of Management and Technolgy) and one of my classmates (Arijit Banerjee - B.P. Poddar Institute of Management and Technolgy) as our 3rd year JAVA project on 2020.
In this project, Swing has been used for the GUI part and for the networking portion, Socket and Port have been used.
As of now, this game can be played on a localhost server (the local machine will act like a server), creating two client instances.
